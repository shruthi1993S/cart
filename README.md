The Context API in React is a powerful tool for managing state across your application without prop drilling (passing props through multiple levels of components). When applied to scenarios like a shopping cart in an e-commerce application, it simplifies how components access and update cart information.

Benefits of Using Context API for Shopping Cart
----------------------------------------------------
Avoids Prop Drilling: Components deep down in the component tree can access cart state and functions directly without props.
Simplified State Management: Centralizes cart state and logic in one place (CartContext), making it easier to manage and scale.
Cleaner Code: Reduces the complexity of passing props through multiple layers of components.
